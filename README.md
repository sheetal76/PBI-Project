# Providing insights to the revenue department in hotel industry

## Problem statement:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

## Objective:
To unlock revenue insights that are not visible before for revenue team and help them to make more data driven decisions.

### key concepts :
1)Revpar: (revenue per available room )= For example take 100 rooms hotel in that if 5 rooms are out of order due to any reason then only 95 rooms are considere as available rooms and revenue calculation done on them only

2)ADR(average daily rate)= total rooms revenue/number of rooms sold

#### Outcome:
We are able to see revenue change week over week and which room category is making profit and on which days the revenue is low.
Based on these KPIs we can make our decision more effectively.
